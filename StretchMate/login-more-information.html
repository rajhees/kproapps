            <h3>I'm a user of the app. Do I need to create an account?</h3>
            <p>You do not need to register or login to Exersite unless your practitioner or trainer has invited you (you will then have a specific program your practitioner / trainer has recommended). If you have not been invited, you can use any of the exercises on the app or create your own program if desired by selecting 'Add to My Exercises' underneath the exercise instructions.</p>

            <a name="patient-without-code"></a>
            <h3>I'm a patient without a code</h3>
            <p>If your practitioner / trainer has suggested you download this app, you should receive an SMS from them containing a code enabling you to register - you will then have your personally prescribed exercises on this app. Alternatively, if you would like to have specific exercises prescribed to you, mention this app to your practitioner / trainer and they can easily register at <a href="http://exersite.com.au">exersite.com.au</a> and start to use this software.</p>

In a few simple steps you will be able to specifically tailor an exercise program to each patient who requires one. They will receive step by step instructions and reminders to carry out their program. This software is free for practitioners.</p>
